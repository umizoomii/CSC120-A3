I worked with Olohi and Tillie, both in office hours and outside of office hours. I attended office hours on Friday 11-12 and Tuesday morning from 9-11:30. The Java syntax was definitely weird to get used to, but this assignment definitely helped me with my understanding of it. I still don't think I have a full understanding of some of the concepts that I ran into during this assignment like strings vs. arrays. However, it taught me more about a lot of concepts like the scanner and splitting/joining strings. I think this project also taught me that I might need to pseudocode more thouroughly before diving into coding. Since I started out with using the .contains method and a bunch of conditional statements, it wouldn't mirror the user's input correctly if it contained more than one keyword. Since I didn't think of this during the pseudocode stage I had to rewrite a lot of code (but sometimes this is inevitable, I guess). To people taking this class in the future I would definitely recommend starting early. I felt pretty relaxed because I was able to get the basic elements working early on, even though I had to change a lot of things.
